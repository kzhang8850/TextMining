<p>For this project, I utilized the Twitch Chat API to access Twitch's chat and then scrape off messages from users and find the top 10 most common words used in a streamer's chat, as well as using sentiment analysis to find the positivity rating of the chat. Twitch is a streaming platform used to live stream many popular video games. One particularly (in)famous thing about Twitch is its chat, a discussion forum almost as bad and troll as reddit. Wanting to see just how troll they really were, I decided to create a program that could access any stream and its chat, mine data from the chat, and then determine what people say the most and how positive the chat was. This project used Twitch API, pickling, and histogram algorithms. Based on multiple runs with my program, it appears that Twitch Chat is indeed quite troll, using many emotes and having terribly low positivity ratings. Go Figure.</p>
